Remittance Report on Suppliers Payment
======================================

We often make suppliers payment by voucher. In some countries like UK supplier
expect us to send remittance advice or Payment order report with reference.

Odoo currently doesn't facilitate such functionality although the remittance
advice report is available through payment order.

This module fill in the gap and add complete clone of payment order report on
account voucher.

Usage
=====

Go to Accounting -> Suppliers -> Supplier Payments and create a new
record.

Print the report.
